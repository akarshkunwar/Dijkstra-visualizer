This project was a simple test of my JS and React skills, as well as a way for me to gain in depth understanding of Dijkstra's by getting firsthand experience.
I have future plans to expand this project into a full pathfinding algorithm visualizer, but at the moment that is on hold as I have been pre-occupied with other projects and academics.
